### Installation and Setup of MQ on OCP ###

The MQ Operator will be installed, if necessary, on OCP and then used to create 4 QMGRs, MFT Coordination, MFT Command, MFT Agent1, and MFT Agent2.  The [IBM Entitlement Key](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary) is necessary before installation the MQ Operator.

Before starting, the user must be logged on to OCP and be the namespace/project that MQ will be installed.
